# How it works

## Automatic start

Spell Book is launched automatically when [supported](supported-apps.md) Adobe app is opened.

## Shortcut listening

Spell Book listens for a shortcut press inside host application only (e.g. for [Quiver](../quiver/) extension, host application will be Premiere Pro).

If host application is not focused on, shortcut assigned in Spell Book won't trigger a command.

## Automatic close

When all supported Adobe apps are closed, Spell Book will close itself within 30 seconds.
