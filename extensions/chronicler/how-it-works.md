# How it works

Chronicler starts tracking right away when project is opened.\
No need to press a button.

If supported, Chronicler also tracks time spent on project items:

* Project panel, sequences and Production Projects in Premiere Pro
* Project panel, compositions in After Effects
* Smart objects in Photoshop
* Links in Illustrator
* Scenes in Animate

If application becomes inactive or user is idle for X amount of time, tracking will stop.
