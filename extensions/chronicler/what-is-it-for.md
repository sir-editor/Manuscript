# What is it for?

> We spend a lot of time in Adobe applications and it is often good to know how much of this time was spent on a specific project, whether for a client or for yourself.
>
> It is possible to track time yourself (using notes or spreadsheets), or with help of tracking applications, though not all of them provide enough details and some require you to press a button to start tracking, which can be easily forgotten.

Chronicler is an extension for Adobe applications, that will track the time for every project **automatically**.
