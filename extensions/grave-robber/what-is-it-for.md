# What is it for?

> In Premiere Pro one can create nests: a sequences that can be used as a clip. However, if one wants to bring clips back from nest, "to un-nest" so to speak, it is not possible.

Grave Robber un-nests selected nests and multicam sequences.

> When merging clips, audio data gets lost thus making it impossible to export proper AAF/OMF files.

Grave Robbe un-merges clips and replaces them with original media, while keeping all applied effects and keyframes.
