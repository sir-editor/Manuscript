# Windows Antivirus

If you have antivirus installed, it might block Grave Robber from simulating a shortcut press. To be sure that Grave Robber works properly, whitelist following file:

**spellcast\_win.exe** â€“ simulates a shortcut press. This one needed for "Keyboard Shortcut", "Apply Transition", "Timecode" commands. Full path:

`C:\Users\*USERNAME*\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\CEP\Extensions\knights_of_the_editing_table.graverobber\client\lib\exec\spellcast_win.exe`
