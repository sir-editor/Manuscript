## Submenu

Some of the commands have a right arrow near the name. That means that command has a submenu, where user can customise its parameters.

To access submenu press **Right Arrow** or **Enter/Return**.

There are few commands that have a default execution:  
[Add Transition](../commands/video-audio-transitions.md), [Audio Effects](../commands/video-audio-effects.md#audio-effects), [Nest Clips](../commands/clip.md#nest-clips), [Solo Tracks](../commands/sequence.md#solo-tracks), [Solo Lock Tracks](../commands/sequence.md#solo-lock-tracks), [Remove Transitions](../commands/clip.md#remove-transitions).
