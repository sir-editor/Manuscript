# macOS Permissions

To allow Excalibur work properly, you will need to give Accessibility permissions for Premiere Pro.

Normaly, after Excalibur installation, when opening Premiere Pro, it should prompt you with dialogs:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/macos_02_popup_input.jpg)

If you don’t have these pop-ups, you can grant permissions manually. Go to:  
**System Preferences &gt; Security & Privacy &gt; Privacy.**  
Go to each section, hit “+", find your Premiere Pro version, add it, make sure it has a tick mark.
