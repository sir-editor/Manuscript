# What is it for?

> Premiere Pro always defaults to the last export location, regardless of which project is exported from. This forces users to set output folder almost every export and this is a lot of mouse clicks.

Compass guides your export to path you defined. If you switch project, Compass will adjust export path accordingly, if output folder doesn't exist Compass can create it.
