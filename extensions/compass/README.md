# Compass

Premiere Pro always defaults to the last export location, regardless of which project media/frame is exported from. This forces users to set output folder almost every export and this is a lot of mouse clicks.\
Same applies to import/replace footage dialog.

**Compass** guides an export of media/frame to a path you defined.\
With relative paths, when a project is changed, Compass will adjust an export path accordingly.\
If an output folder doesn't exist Compass will create it.\
And wildcard names give more control over export folder organisation.
