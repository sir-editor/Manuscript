# How it works

Compass controls following Premiere Pro settings:

* Export Media path
* Export Frame path

### Relative path

When **R** button is active Compass will use path that is relative to current project file. This is useful for projects that use folder structure templates.

{% hint style="info" %}
If project is a part of Production, then path will be relative to Production folder.
{% endhint %}

### Wildcard names

To have more control over path, use [wildcard names](wildcard-names.md) to create dynamic folder names for each project.

When input is activated, wildcards will appear below input.\
Click on any of them to insert a wildcard at cursor position.

### Override settings

Compass settings affect all projects. If needed settings could be changed for a specific project. Settings will be active whenever the project becomes active.

### Folder Creation

If export path does not exist, Compass will create all necessary folders.

### Supported Export Media dialogs

Compass supports all types of export dialogs:

* Export Media dialog
* Export tab (Premiere Pro 2022 and after)
* Quick Export
* Export from Media Encoder queue

## Languages

Compass is translated to all Premiere Pro supported languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.
