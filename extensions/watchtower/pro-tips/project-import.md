# Project import

To import After Effects and Premiere Pro project files, go to settings and turn on checkbox for .aep and .prproj extensions.

#### 

#### Premiere Pro tip:

Before importing .prproj file with Watchtower, import one file by yourself, import dialog will appear, select: ”Create folder for imported items”.  
After that all imported .prproj files will have their own folders.
