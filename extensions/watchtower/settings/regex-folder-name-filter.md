# Regex folder name filter

Regular expressions  (shortened as **regex** or **regexp**) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.

To use regex filter enclose search pattern in slashes: "/temp/, "/\d/"\
Regex filter is case-insensitive.

For example you have folders generated by Media Encoder, it takes project name and attaches "\_AME" to the end of it:

> **"Project\_1\_AME", "Project\_2\_AME", "Project\_3\_AME", etc**

Instead of strictly defining name filter for each folder, you can set one regex filter:

> **"/\_AME/"**

### Example usage:

* **/\_ame/** — filter folder that has “\_ame” in name: “project\_ame”, “south\_America”, “\_amethyst"
* **/\_ame$/** — filter folder that has “\_ame” at the end of the name:  “project\_AME”
* **/^\_ame/** —filter folder that has “\_ame at the start if the name: “\_amethyst"
* **/\d/** — filter folder that has any digit in name: “100\_images”, “image\_5\_best”
