Folder tree shows files on local and network drives. By default tree unfolds up to your project location.

When you select folders to import Watchtower autodetects folders with image sequences inside and camera folders, so you can skip Advanced part and click “Ok”.

**F** - flatten sub-folders (useful for camera cards)\
**R** - use relative path (useful for project templates)
