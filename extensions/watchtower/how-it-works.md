Watchtower uses idea of watch folders â€” pre-defined folders that constantly look for any new content that is added to them.\

Watchtower compares [<mark style="background-color:green;">**file paths**</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] of already imported media and incoming media to determine if file is not in the project and should be imported.
