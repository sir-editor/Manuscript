## Add start marker

If [Auto-mark audio clips](settings.md#auto-mark-audio-clips) is enabled, start marker will be added automatically, when audio clips are added to Quiver, at the loudest part.

To add start marker manually:

* Open Start marker panel
* Open clip in Source Monitor
* Move playhead
* Press "Add start marker"

Start marker will be added at the playhead position.

When adding start marker to a sequence item in Quiver, you can just activate sequence itself (without Source monitor) and add start marker there.
