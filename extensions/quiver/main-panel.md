<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Quiver_methods.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Available methods and their actions are listed below:

<table><thead><tr><th width="155">Method</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Overlay</td><td>If targeted track has a clip at playhead, added clip will be added to the first empty track above.</td></tr><tr><td>Overwrite</td><td>Ignores any clip at playhead and overwrites it with a clip.</td></tr><tr><td>Insert*</td><td>Ignores any clip at playhead, inserts a clip and pushes forward all clips on a targeted track.</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
**\*Insert** method is not available for MOGRT items, due to API limitation.
{% endhint %}

## Target track

By default clips will be added to the bottom targeted track.

You can change it for each item and specify destination track by its name.

{% hint style="info" %}
If track name is not listed, create new track in active sequence and name it the way you need.
{% endhint %}

After track name is selected, it will be shown on an item button.

### Creation of tracks

If a clip targets a track with a name and such track doesn't exist, track will be created.

If a clip uses "**Overlay**" method and a track with name is occupied, new track with incremented name will be created (e.g. "**Sword 2**" is occupied, "**Sword 3**" will be created).
