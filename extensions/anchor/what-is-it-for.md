# What is it for?

> When one tries to reposition an anchor point of a clip, it requires changing both anchor point and position values if it is done through effects control or it can be done manually and not precise in program monitor.

Anchor moves an anchor point to one of 9 pre-defined positions with one click.\
It also allows to use clip's alpha channel.&#x20;
