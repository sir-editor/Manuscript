# What is it for?

API for Adobe products doesn't expose a shortcuts press, so it is impossible for 3rd party developers to use shortcuts in their extensions.\
There is possibility to assign shortcuts for single scripts in After Effects and Photoshop, but other applications missing this feature.

Spellbook solves that.
